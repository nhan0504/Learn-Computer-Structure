# Hardware component
- **Case:** Houses other hardware component
- **Power supply:** Supply power to all other components in the computer system
- **Motherboard:** The backbone of the computer system. Other components plug in to the motherboard
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** Perform functions, calculations and executing commands. Performance measure
    - Clock speed(Ghz): How many clock cycles per second
    - Core: Multi core and hyper-threading (quad-core, 6-core, 8-core)
- **RAM (Random access memory):** Storage is cleared when computer powered-down. Stores programs and files currently in use -> Faster access and reading. Different types include: writable vs. read-only, static vs. dynamic, volatile vs. non-volatile, etc.

- **Hard drive:** Long-term digital storage. 
    - SSD (Solid-State Drive): Most computer use SSD. SSD uses flash memory and semiconductor chips -> Lower failure rate than HHD. SSD can be internal or external (USB, Flash drives)
    - HHD: Use rotating disks and magnetics
- **Graphics Card:** To see output that a computer system is producing
- **Input and output devices:** 
    - Input: Keyboard, mouse, microphone,...
    - Output: Monitor, printer, speaker,...
